# Professional-Portfolio-Wayne

Hi, this is Wayne's very first portfolio.
This build focus on sizing the elements so it will fit on either big or small screens.
Navigation function is working so when you click tags on the nav bar, it will direct you to the corresponding section.
A little Pseudo Elments were added when you hover or click certain items.
The color choice and design are not so great and I am trying to improve it.

Enjoy your time playing around it and thank you!!
